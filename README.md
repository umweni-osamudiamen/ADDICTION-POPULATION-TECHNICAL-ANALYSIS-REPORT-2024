Analysis Recommendation
1. Recommendation would be a public education / enlightenment on the dangers of smoking and the hazard it pose to the health of a person both active and none active smoker.

2. Recommendation based on observations that student are highly involve in addiction matters, Security detailing and careful monitoring of students who are mostly involve in this action.

3. School authorities university, high school, primary should place a total ban on smoking within campus, since many will not smoke while at home.

4. Considering the percentage of those that attempted to quit smoking and those that didn’t, recommendation would be that a new approach be employed in the management of these addicts, reward for successive abstinence.

5. Public education the danger of alcoholic drinks like liver cirrhosis and kidney damage should be emphasized to discourage smokers.

6. Parent should avoid drinking and smoking in their presence of their kids since addiction to these items cut across all schooling category.

7. Recommendation all country is for them to enforce ban on public smoking that mitigate the effect on none smoker and those with poor threshold to be influence.

Conclusion:
From the analysis, educational level has little or no impact on people decision to smoke or drink as seen from the analysis, a reasonable number of people started smoking as an undergraduate. It was also noticed that the supposedly employed people smokes in more so lack of engage may not also be why people smoke and considering the number of children that engage in these activities, it could be said that poor parenting is a factor.
Future research should be geared towards the impact of parenting on children’s addiction and use of controlled substances.
